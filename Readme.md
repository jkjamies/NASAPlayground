# Improvement Ideas

- Add parameters to allow for different dates or date ranges
- Strings resources and localization
- Kotlin/Wasm to host documentation through GitHub pages via workflow
- Add a work manager to schedule the updates so data is always up to date when user opens the app
- Notifications when the work manager updates the data
- Favorites that persist either outside of the date ranges or just indicators for an exclusive list
